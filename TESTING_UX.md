# Testing the UX Enhancements

## Quick Start

To see the new design in action:

```bash
# If not already in demo mode, you can view with your real data
streamlit run app.py

# Or switch to demo mode to see sample data
python scripts/demo_mode.py
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will automatically load the new theme from `.streamlit/config.toml` and apply custom CSS styling.
