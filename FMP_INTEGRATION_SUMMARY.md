# FMP Integration Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully implemented Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API as the primary data source for portfolio price updates, replacing the unreliable yfinance service.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Module: `portodash/fmp.py`
- **Batch Quote Fetching**: `fetch_batch_quotes_fmp()` fetches all tickers in a single API call
- **Single Ticker Wrapper**: `fetch_quote_fmp()` for individual ticker lookups
- **API Key Management**: `get_fmp_api_key()` reads from environment
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive handling for timeouts, rate limits, network errors, and malformed responses
- **30-second timeout** to prevent hanging

### 2. Updated: `portodash/data_fetch.py`
- **Multi-tier fallback strategy**:
  1. FMP (primary) - 250 req/hour
  2. yfinance (fallback) - backup when FMP unavailable
  3. historical.csv cache (final) - when all sources fail
- **Origins tracking**: Now includes 'fmp', 'yfinance', and 'cache' source types
- **Batch efficiency**: Single API call for all 11-12 portfolio tickers

### 3. Updated: `.env.sample`
- Added `FMP_API_KEY` configuration with setup instructions
- Marked `ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY` as deprecated (25 req/day too restrictive)

### 4. Updated: `README.md`
- Added Prerequisites section with FMP API key setup
- Updated Features to reflect FMP as primary source
- Added environment configuration steps
- Clear documentation of 250 req/hour limit

### 5. Test Script: `test_fmp_integration.py`
- Tests all 11 unique tickers from your portfolio
- Validates TSX (.TO) and US ticker formats
- Clear pass/fail reporting

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Get your FMP API key** (if you haven't already):
   - Visit https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/
   - Sign up (no credit card required)
   - Copy your API key

2. **Set the environment variable**:
   ```bash
   export FMP_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

3. **Run the test script**:
   ```bash
   python test_fmp_integration.py
   ```
   This will test all your tickers: FFFFX, FBGRX, XEQT.TO, XCH.TO, ZAG.TO, VE.TO, XUU.TO, XEF.TO, XEC.TO, XIC.TO, XBB.TO

4. **Launch the dashboard**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   Click "Refresh prices" and verify fresh data loads successfully

5. **Check the data source indicator**:
   - Should show "Source: fmp" or "Source: mixed" if some tickers fell back to yfinance
   - Verify timestamps are current (not 24+ hours old)

## Pull Request

**PR #21**: https://github.com/RegisCA/portodash/pull/21

The PR is ready for your review and testing. Once you've:
1. Set your FMP API key
2. Run the test script successfully
3. Verified the dashboard loads fresh prices

You can merge the PR to complete the integration!

## Benefits

- ✅ **Reliability**: 250 req/hour free tier (vs yfinance's harsh undocumented limits)
- ✅ **Efficiency**: All tickers in 1 API call (not 11-12 separate calls)
- ✅ **No payment**: Free tier requires no credit card
- ✅ **TSX support**: .TO suffix works directly
- ✅ **Acceptable delay**: 15-30 minute delayed data is fine for portfolio tracking
- ✅ **Proper fallbacks**: Still uses yfinance and cache when needed

## Breaking Change Note

⚠️ The app requires `FMP_API_KEY` environment variable for fresh price updates. Without it, the app falls back to yfinance (still rate-limited) and cached data.
